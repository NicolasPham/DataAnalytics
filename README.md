```python
- List:
  > List.append(value): add a value into a list
  > List.extend([value1, value2]): add value1 and value2 into a list
  > del List[index]: delete a value at index
  > List[1:3] : slice elements 1 and 2 from a list
  > List.index(value): find the index of a value in a list
  > List.sort(reverse = True): sort the list in reverse order
  
- Loops:
  > for n in list_name:
    print(n, end = " ")
    # print a list horrizontally
  
  > x = 0
  > while x <= 20:
    print(x)
    x += 2 #incrementing x
    
  > for item in x:
    print (item, end = " ")
    
  > for n in range(len(x)):
    print (x[n], end = " ")
